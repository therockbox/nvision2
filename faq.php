					<h4>Common questions our clients have asked us:</h4>
					<dl>
						<dt>How fast can I have my website up?</dt>
						<dd>Every project has different goals and requirements. The turn around on your project will be determined by the information our team gathers throughout the <a href="services.php#projectphases" class="link">phases</a> and what can be reasonably produced given our schedule with other clients.</dd>

						<dt>How does nVision determine prices?</dt>
						<dd>Prices are determined by what requirements your project needs, such as the number of pages, custom graphics/animation, and any system integration that needs to be done by our developers. This will all be covered in our meetings with you.</dd>

						<dt>Why pay for a site when I see services advertised that allow me to do it for free?</dt>
						<dd>Many sites offer templates that have been used on hundreds of other sites, and often limit the customization the user has over its content. The websites we build our custom made for our clients.</dd>

						<dt>Do you offer continuing site maintenance?</dt>
						<dd>Yes.</dd>

						<dt>Can you help me redesign my existing website?</dt>
						<dd>Yes. We can meet with you to figure out what exactly you're looking for in a redesign.</dd>

						<dt>Will my website look identical to all users?</dt>
						<dd>It is well known that there exist browser compatability issues that can make a website look or function differently depending on the browser the user is using. While there are certain features and enhancements in newer browser versions that aren't possible in older ones, we strive to ensure that the user experience is as identical as possible.</dd>

						<dt>Can I view the number of visitors to my site?</dt>
						<dd>Yes. We can set up statistical tracking software on your site that will track incoming traffic.</dd>

						<dt>Will you display ads or pop-ups on my website?</dt>
						<dd>No! We do not display any ads or pop-ups on our clients' sites unless it is actually part of their site.</dd>

						<dt>Do you utilize Flash animation on projects?</dt>
						<dd>Yes. We are capable of producing Flash animation for our clients. Pleaes note that at times Flash may not be the most efficient technology to use as a solution. We will go over the pros and cons in this area with you to help you determine the best direction.</dd>

						<dt>Do your developers adhere to optimizations to improve site response time?</dt>
						<dd>Yes. We follow industry best practices to improve loading time as much as possible, including compressing files, optimizing images, and trimming down the code.</dd>
